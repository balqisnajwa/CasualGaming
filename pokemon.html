      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Pokemon Shield</b></p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">As the title goes, the game is called Pokemon Sword <em>and</em> Shield. Meaning, there are two games released and I bought Pokemon Shield. It is like a trademark for <b>GameFreak</b>, the developer of this game, to release two Pokemon games at the same time. I remember when I was still a kid, I watched both of my older brothers playing Pokemon Red on our computer since we do not have the game console. They are the biggest influence on me getting involved with Pokemon and to be honest, I have no regrets. Instead, I am grateful that I was exposed to Pokemon world.</p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">The uniqueness of Pokemon game series is, in each game, there will be different pokemon <em>version</em> that are exclusive and only available in each game. For example, you can only find Galarian Ponyta in Pokemon Shield, while in Pokemon Sword, you can find Galarian Farfetch'd but not Galarian Ponyta. But not to worry, you can get both of them through trade system online with other player! Like me, I had purchased an online membership for my Nintendo account. So, I am able to trade online. Player cannot trade pokemon if they do not have the online membership.<em>(p/s: Galar is the name of the region in SWSH, hence the term Galarian)</em></p>

      <h2 style="color:saddlebrown;">My Team</h2>
      <h5 style="color:darkolivegreen;">Great team, June 8, 2020.</h5>

      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>My precious team</b></p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">As you can see in the video, those are my pokemons that helped and accompanied me throughout my whole journey in Pokemon Shield. The first pokemon I got is fire type pokemon, Scorbunny. He is one of the starter that I had chose. Even though this is only a game, I really dote on my pokemons. You could say I love them from the bottom of my heart since I had <em>raised</em> them from they were still in their lowest level. They are very special to me and that is why I never got bored from playing Pokemon Shield.</p>

      <h2 style="color:saddlebrown;">Defeating the Champion</h2>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">Dynamax and Gigantamax, June 8, 2020.</p>
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/9azWrb0DF8">pic.twitter.com/9azWrb0DF8</a></p>&mdash; ‚Åé‚Å∫üçä‚úß (@balqisramly) <a href="https://twitter.com/balqisramly/status/1331400857380741122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Dynamax time</b></p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">One of the new feature in Pokemon SWSH is called <em>Dynamax</em> and <em>Gigantamax.</em> These feature is literally a process where you make your pokemon bigger than its usual size. Though this form will lasts only for 4 turns. After that, your pokemon will return to its original form. For Gigantamax, only certain pokemon will have it. Gigantamax form is a little different from Dynamax. Unlike Dynamax form that can only make your pokemon big, Gigantamax can change a certain pokemon into different form. It is more unique than the usual Dynamax. However, both form can only be used in the stadium, the place where battle take part.</p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">Now, for me to win against the Pokemon Champion, which is Leon, I had leveled up all of my pokemon to at least level 70 and above. It was an easy battle since my pokemon's level is higher than the campions'. I usually use the Dynamax form after the opponent only have one pokemon left. And thanks to that, I won the battle and became the new champion!</p>

      <h2 style="color:saddlebrown;">Camping</h2>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">Bonding time, June 10, 2020.</p>

      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Treat your pokemon</b></p>
      <p style="color:darkolivegreen;">One more new feature in Pokemon SWSH is player can now camp with all six of their pokemons. Player can also join other player's camp but can only bring one pokemon of their own since the other player already has six pokemon in their parties. In this feature, you can play with your pokemon by using <em>PokeToy</em> (as shown in the picture above), play with a ball, and even cook curry with them. I spent most of my time by playing with my pokemon because their reaction are cute! I really like this feature since I get to actually spend my time with my pokemon instead of them just sitting inside their pokeball.</p>
