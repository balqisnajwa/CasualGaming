			<h2 style="color:saddlebrown;">About BOTW</h2>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</em> or also known as <em>BOTW,</em> was released on 3 March 2020. It is a game where you can literally do anything you want. You can try many new unique strategy on enemies, cook and try many new recipes, climb everywhere you want, and more. Its main mission is for you to defeat the enemy that appeared 100 years ago in Hyrule. To simplify, it is a game that allows you to do anything you want and you will not feel pressured in trying to complete the quests given. Here are some of the preview I took in BOTW:</p>

			</div>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">On 12 June 2020, my new game that I ordered online, which is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, had safely arrived at my house. I remember how excited I am to play BOTW. My first impression about BOTW was how mesmerized I am towards the graphic and the view of it. At first, I was afraid to even start the game because I know BOTW genre is an action-adventure game and I had never liked that genre. I always get nervous when it comes to action genre. However, this game had changed my feelings and perceptions I used to have on action genre. It is very enjoyable and it had never made me feel bored during the time I play it. Instead, I find myself keep coming to this game even though I had long finished it. Plus, I am now trying to play action-adventure genre games as much as I could. Alright, let me talk about my experience of playing BOTW.</p>

			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Collecting Korok Seed</b></p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">The first time I play this, I had no idea that I need to collect these seeds in order for me to be able to add an empty slot for my weapons. So, being a curious person I am, I searched on how to add slots for my weapons and thankfully, there are tons of guide about BOTW on the Internet. From reading the guide, I was told to collect these seeds. How to collect, you ask? There will be places that you will find it weird. It feels like there are things that is not supposed to be there. For example, in the photos above, I was aiming to shoot some sort of hot air balloon. I find those by chance because there was a pinwheel on a tree stump. That is why, it is important to explore Hyrule because BOTW is full of small puzzles. If you think that finding the Korok Seeds is a hassle, you can just not do it because it is not compulsory for players to collect the seeds. Like me, I can just use the available slots but I chose not to. For me, the more weapon slots I have, the more beneficial it would be for me. Hence, that is why I collect the seeds.</p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">In total, there are 900 seeds to be collected. Of course, I would not be able to collect all of them but I do managed to collect at least 200+ seeds. I could say, most of my free time were spent on this game and I do not regret it. Instead, I feel satisfied since I can release my stress.</p>

			</div>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>BOTW:</b>Stunning and serene</p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">Now, I know I had been talking about how beautiful the view is so many time. And yes, I will continue to talk about it again! As you can see in the photo, it is a screenshot of sunset from the game. I find myself to always take some time to look around the view and it calms me. I am amazed on how the developers are capable to create such beautiful view. The accuracy of colour usage is almost the same as the real sunset! No wonder it was nominated and <b><em>is</em></b> the Game Of The Year (GOTY) for 2017.</p>

			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Sword that seals the darkness</b></p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">Every game have that one special weapon that allows you to defeat enemies easily and in this case, it was the <em>Master Sword.</em> This sword is the signature weapon for <em>The Legend Of Zelda</em> series. In order to obtain this sword, player should at least have 13 hearts to be able to pull out the sword that was placed deep in <em>Korok Forest.</em> It was hard for me to find the forest at first since I kept getting lost due to some playful creature plays a trick on me and send me back to the forest entrance. This happens if I do not follow the right path. For the total of hearts, I already have 14 hearts. So, it was not a problem for me to pull out the sword.</p>

			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;"><b>Watch out for enemies</b></p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">There are many types of enemy in BOTW. I would say, BOTW has at least 14 types of enemy and each of them has different colour. Their colour proves how strong the enemy would be. There are red, blue, black, white, and lastly gold. Those colours I had stated are arranged according to their strength. However, the gold ones are only available after you purchase an expansion pack. It is not neccessary for me to buy it since I am already satisfied with the game.</p>
			<p style="color:darkolivegreen;">As you can see in the photos above, the first two photos is me defeating an enemy called <em>Lynel</em>. If someone ask me whether they are strong or not, I would say yes. They are unbelievably hard to defeat and took at least 15 minutes for me to defeat them. I think Lynels are harder to defeat than the actual main enemy: <em>Ganon.</em>For the next two photos, the enemy is called <em>Guardian.</em>They are the most annoying enemy as they are able to shoot laser from their eyes. One hit, and you could lose half of your hearts. Even bad, you could die from it.</p>
